# portaudio-cpp-sine: "hello audio" with C++ and PortAudio
Bart Massey 2024

This very simple PortAudio / C++ demo plays a 1KHz
one-second sine wave on the default audio device.

It is only *known* to work on Linux. You will need the
`portaudio-dev` and `libasound2` packages installed to build
and run it.
